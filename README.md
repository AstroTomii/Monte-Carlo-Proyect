# Monte-Carlo-Proyect
This is a repository for the computational astronomy course
## Necessary libraries
To run this code we need:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import pandas as pd
## Monte Carlo Code
In order to run the Monte Carlo code, with the number of stars you want, you must change the cell:
test = monte_carlo(10000000)
Note: Very low numbers may return empty lists since the masses have not passed the test
